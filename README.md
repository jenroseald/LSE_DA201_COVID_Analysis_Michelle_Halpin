### Assignment Brief

To act as a data analyst working with the UK government to analyse COVID-19 data (from January 2020 to October 2021).

### Context

As part of its goal to increase the number of fully vaccinated individuals (people who have received a first and second dose of the vaccine), the government is planning to launch a series of marketing campaigns to promote the vaccine. The government wants to identify trends and patterns that can be used to inform its marketing approach to increase the number of fully vaccinated people.

### Required Actions

Use Python to analyse the data to identify patterns and trends that could help inform the UK governments marketing strategy to promote the vaccine and ultimately increase the vaccination rate. The government would like to understand:

- Total vaccinations (first dose, second dose per region, total and overtime) are for a particular region
- Where they should target the first marketing campaign(s) based on:

    - area(s) with the largest number of people who have received a first dose but no second dose
    - area with the greatest number of recoveries so that they can avoid this area in their initial campaign runs
    - whether deaths have been increasing across all regions over time or if a peak has been reached
    - what other types of Twitter data points and tweets have both #coronavirus and #vaccinated hashtags
    - which regions have experienced a peak in hospitalisation numbers and if there are regions that have not reached a peak yet
